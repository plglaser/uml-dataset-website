Your company has been commissioned to develop an application for managing customers, products, orders, and similar items for a company that sells clothing. You are responsible for designing the application. The customer provides you with the following information:
"We offer all kinds of clothing—from shoes to headwear, we have everything in our range. Our products have a unique name, a description, and a net price. We also know which company manufactured each product and in which country. In order to calculate the gross price of an item, which depends on the local VAT rate in each country, we need information about the VAT rate, the currency used, and a conversion rate to the euro for each country. We also do not sell every product in every country – this should also be queryable in some way. Our products are distributed through representatives, whose first and last names, social security numbers, telephone numbers, and email addresses must be stored. Each representative is responsible for exactly one country. The customer data includes name, address, telephone number, email address, and the countries in which they resell our goods. Orders from customers are placed by the representatives. Each order is uniquely identifiable and refers to exactly one product. It must include the order quantity, the order date, and the desired delivery date.
