A gas station chain wants to manage its gas stations electronically in the future. Model the following situation using a UML class diagram based on the following information:
Each gas station has a unique ID and an address. It also has a number of fuel pumps (maximum 12), each of which is identified by a number. It is also noted whether or not it is a self-service fuel pump. For each fuel pump, it is known which fuels are offered at it. A fuel is uniquely identified by its name, and its octane rating is also noted.
Each gas station archives all daily fuel prices. A daily price is identified by a date, the fuel to which it applies, and the gas station. The price per liter is also noted. A fuel purchase is uniquely identified by an ID, and it is noted at which fuel pump the fuel was purchased and which fuel was purchased at which daily price. In addition, the number of liters of fuel dispensed is also stored.
