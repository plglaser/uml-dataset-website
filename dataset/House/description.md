The address and building material (wood, brick, or concrete) of each house are stored. A house may have a basement, the size and name of which are stored. There are exactly two different types of basements: earth basements and concrete basements. The humidity level of earth basements is also stored. A special type of house is the semi-detached house. Additional information stored for this type of house includes whether it has its own garden and how many windows it has. Each semi-detached house has either two carports or a garage. For carports, information stored includes whether they are double carports and whether they have a flat roof; for garages, information stored includes whether they have an automatic garage door. Each house is serviced by several companies, whose names and addresses are stored. Whenever a company carries out a job in a house, the number of hours and the agreed price are recorded in a job log.
