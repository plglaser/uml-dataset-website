Locations consist of drivers with first and last names and vehicles. Each location has its own address. There are three types of vehicles: trucks, cars and vans. Each vehicle has a vehicle number. While trucks also have a certain weight, passenger cars have a certain number of seats. In addition to vehicles and drivers, orders are also managed. Orders are carried out by drivers. Drivers carry out a maximum of one order assigned to them at any one time. Orders always have an origin and a destination location, at least one assigned driver and the date of execution. In addition to order management, the system also records which vehicles are driven by which driver. For this purpose, vehicles are assigned up to one driver who drives these vehicles.
